# üöó Motor Vehicle Accident Collision Analysis üìä

This project focuses on analyzing motor vehicle accident collision data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualizations to better understand factors contributing to crashes and their impacts.

## üóÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **29 columns** and provides detailed information on motor vehicle accidents, including:
- Crash dates, times, and locations.
- Injuries and fatalities (pedestrians, cyclists, motorists).
- Contributing factors and vehicle types involved.

### Key Dataset Features:
- **Time-related data**: `CRASH DATE`, `CRASH TIME`.
- **Geographical data**: `BOROUGH`, `ZIP CODE`, `LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE`.
- **Impact data**: Injuries and fatalities for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.
- **Contributing factors**: Multiple vehicles' contributing factors.

## üõ† Key Analytical Questions

1. **Time-Based Analysis**:
   - Extracted day of the week, month, and year from `CRASH DATE`.
   - Extracted hour from `CRASH TIME`.
   - Determined if a crash occurred during the day or night.
   - Analyzed crash frequency across time periods.

2. **Crash Frequency and Trends**:
   - Trend analysis of crash rates over years.
   - Crash frequency by day of the week and month.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - Summary statistics of injuries and fatalities by borough.
   - Pedestrian injuries and severity trends by time of day.

4. **Vehicle Type Analysis**:
   - Top vehicle types involved in crashes.
   - Frequency of crashes by vehicle type.

5. **Contributing Factors**:
   - Identified top contributing factors for crashes.
   - Tabulated contributing factors by borough.

6. **Visualizations**:
   - Crash trends over years: Line Plot.
   - Crash frequency by day of the week and month: Bar Plot.
   - Crashes by time of day: Pie Chart.
   - Injuries and fatalities by borough: Bar Plot.
